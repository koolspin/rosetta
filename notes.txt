Some notes about this project:

DONE 1. The web server (tornado_source) should have a different non-required output pin for each of the http verbs.
DONE 2. This will allow us to wire up filter graphs that correspond to the user's action (GET is much different than POST)
DONE 2a. If the output pin is not wired, should return (throw) a http 405 response. GET and HEAD should return empty info.
DONE 3. sqlite passthru needs to handle unique columns properly. Upsert should make this easier.
4. For simplicity, maybe we should only support a single unique column per table?
5. Need to support stop command at the filter level so that filters can intelligently shut themselves down
